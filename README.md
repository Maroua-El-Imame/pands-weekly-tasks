# Programming and Scripting Weekly Tasks

This repository is in allignment with the tasks proposed in the module of Programming and Scripting.  
It showcases my progressive learning based on the moduleâ€™s lectures, demonstrates my ability to conduct independent research, interpret and apply relevant documentation and external resources.

This repository contains eight distinct tasks, each approached with a different method to demonstrate a range of programming techniques

## **Weekly Tasks Overview  :**
The Tasks files are located in this repository in .py format.

### Task 1 
helloworld.py  
This file contains a python program that displays Hello World! when it is run.  
The "Hello, World!" is mainly used as first program. It's a classic example used in programming to demonstrate the basic syntax for beginners.

### Task 2
bank.py  
This program returns in euro the sum of two amounts entered in cents.  

*   *Applied method* :  
    Arithmetic operators  ( + , / , - , . . .): are fundamental for performing mathematical calculations.

### Task 3
accounts.py  
1.This program reads in a 10 character account number and outputs its first 6 digits replaced by x and only shows the last 4 digits.  
2.The program is then modified to read an account number of any length and only shows its last 4 digits.

*   *Applied method* :  
    -Slicing : is a Python feature that allows access and extract a range of elements in a sequence.   

    -Negative indexing : is used to access elements of a sequence, such as a list or a string, from the end rather than the beginning.  

    -String replace : is used to replace part of a string with another substring. This method allows to specify the old substring and the new substring that will replace it.  

### Task 4
collatz.py  
Collatz is a sequence of numbers produced from a starting number n. The code prompts thh user to inter a number n, if n is even it will be divided by 2, if n is odd, it will multiply it by 3 and adds 1. The program ends when it reaches the value 1.

*   *Applied method*:    
    The Collatz Sequence.

### Task 5
weekday.py  
This program outputs whether or not today is a weekday.  
This programs prints "Yes, unfortunately today is a weekday." if it matches a weekday, otherwise, it prints" It is the weekend, yay!" if it's matching the weekend. 

*   *Applied method* :  
    Datetime module in Python : provides classes for manipulating dates and times.

### Task 6
squareRoot.py  
a 'sqrt' function.  
This program takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.  
This program is not using python built-in functions x**5 or math.sqrt(x)

*   *Applied method*  :  
    Newton method : a root-finding method, it starts with an initial guess, then improves the estimate of the root using repeated calculations, getting closer to the actual root with each iteration. 

### Task 7 
es.py   
This program reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains while dealing with different error types.

*   *Applied method*  :  
    OS module    
    SYS module  

### Task 8
plottask.py  
This program when run, displays:  
1.Histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2.   
2.Plot of the function h(x)=x**3 in the range 0 to 10  

*   *Applied method*  :  
    Numpy: Numerical Library in Python  
    Matplotlib: Python Plotting library

## Environment Setup :
| Python in Git     |
|----------|

-Navigate to github  
-Click Sign up  
-Follow the prompts to create a personal account.  
***  
-Go to github.  
-Log in to your account.  
-Click the new repository button in the top-right **'+'** symbol   
-Follow [steps](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)  
-Click create repository.  
***  
-On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.  
-Under the repository name, select the code dropdown menu.  
-Click Create codespace on main.  
-From menu top left click on View > Explorer -  
-Under repository title (in bold) click on New file  
-Lower case file name, then add .ipynb extension ( for notebook format) or .py extension ( for python file).  
-Follow steps from developing a code to committing then lastly syncing changes.

| Python on Windows     |
|----------|

[Download cmder](https://cmder.app/)  
[Download notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)  
[Download anaconda (python)](https://www.anaconda.com/download)   
[Download vs code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)  

*** 
*   Open VS Code and select "File > New File",  
    Save the file as .py format (e.g., my_script.py).  
    Write a Python script in the file.  

*   With Python file open in VS Code, launch the terminal (see vscode menu)  
    Navigate through the terminal until reaching the same directory where Python file is located.  
    Possible to use Cmder for running Python code (CAT). Same as in Vs code, navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved using the cd command.  

    Cmder is mainly for command-line usage, while VS Code is where would most of coding and debugging run.   

*   Lastly, steps to [clone repository using command line](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)  
    Clone allows to copy the repository from GitHub to the local machine  
    Changes can be pushed to the remote repository on GitHub and/or pulled from Github into the local machine.
