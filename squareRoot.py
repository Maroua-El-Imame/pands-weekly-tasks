# squareRoot.py
# creating 'sqrt' function.
# This program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
# This program is not using python built-in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x)

# steps :
#   1. understand the question:
#   What's a squareRoot ?
#   The square root of a number is a number that when multiplied by itself gives the actual number.

#   2. Identify the arguments needed for the calculation.
#    we need the result(number) to which we try and find its square root(a number when multiplied by itself prooducts the result(number))

#   3. what's the desired outcome ?
#   The square root of a result(number)

#   Example : The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. In other words:
#               We know that 5 Ã— 5 = 25, in this case, the square root of 25 is 5.
#   Let's find out how to identify the square root.
